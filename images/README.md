This is the folder for all the images and sounds used in the game.
While running the program, make sure all these files are inside the folder named 'images'.
Do not change the file names. If you want to change them, also change them in the code 'Board.py' correspondingly.
The code file 'Board.py' and the folder 'images' must be in  the same root while running the program.
I do not own any of these images or sounds.
